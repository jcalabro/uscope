//! Where Go's variables are visible. Go describes a local's scope by its
//! block's code, which unoptimized builds do not divide into blocks, so a
//! local would seem to exist before its declaration has run. As Delve
//! does, a Go local is visible only where the line executing is past the
//! line declaring it, and a block's code includes its nested blocks'.
//!
//! The line executing at an address is the site of the call inlined
//! directly into the local's scope that contains the address, and
//! otherwise the line of the code itself. It is asked of the image at the
//! address queried, so loading computes nothing per local.
