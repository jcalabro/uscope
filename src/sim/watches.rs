//! Watch accounting: the watchpoint hits the debugger reports at a stop
//! against the accesses the CPU made to watched memory since the last.
//!
//! Every access a slot covers traps, so a thread that accessed a watched
//! range was stopped there. A watchpoint on stores or on any access reports
//! each such thread; one on changes reports the threads that stored once
//! the watched bytes differ from those at the last stop, and none when a
//! store left them as they were or another thread undid it.
//!
//! Every access a watchpoint on stores or on any access reports is a hit,
//! and every hit of one on changes is a store, so the hits it counted since
//! the last stop are exactly, or at most, the accesses made since. A
//! watchpoint with a hit condition or a condition reports only the hits its
//! policies let stop, so the client knows of no access it must report.
