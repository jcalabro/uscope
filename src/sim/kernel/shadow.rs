//! Shadow state: what threads really did, kept where the debugger cannot
//! see or change it, for the semantic oracles.
//!
//! Each thread's shadow call stack holds the calls it made and has not
//! returned from, as the CPU executed them; backtraces are judged by it.
//! While the client steps a thread, the kernel also records each
//! instruction that thread completed, so the stepping oracle can tell where
//! a step should have stopped. A trap the thread hit is no instruction it
//! passed.
