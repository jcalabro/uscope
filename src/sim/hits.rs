//! What the client asks its breakpoints to do at their hits, and the check

//!
//! Every hit counts. A hit stops when its breakpoint's hit condition
//! accepts the hit's number, its condition holds, or fails to evaluate,
//! which stops too, and it logs no message; a breakpoint that logs logs
//! instead of stopping. The client knows whether a condition holds at every
//! hit only where it can tell without the debugger: a constant, or a
//! source marker's condition, or its negation, at the start of the
//! marker's line in unoptimized code. Elsewhere it accepts either outcome.
//!
//! A disabled breakpoint counts nothing and stops nowhere. A temporary one
//! is gone from the snapshot of the stop it causes, and a breakpoint the
//! client keeps vanishes in no other way.
