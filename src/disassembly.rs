//! Platform-neutral disassembly.
//!
//! Machine code has no self-describing instruction boundaries on variable
//! length architectures, so decoding from an arbitrary address can produce a
//! convincing but wrong instruction stream. The engine therefore decodes only
//! forward from proven instruction starts: a stopped thread's program
//! counter, the start of a function's debug-information range, the start of
//! a code symbol, or the start of an executable section. Every known start it passes must coincide with a decoded
//! boundary; when one does not, the conflict is reported and decoding resumes
//! at the known start. Instructions before an address are presented only when
//! decoding forward from a known start lands exactly on that address.
//!
//! An indirect jump, call, or return is resolved against the stopped state:
//! the memory it loads its target from is read at the stop, and registers
//! are used only for the instruction the selected thread is about to
//! execute, the one place the stop determines them.
