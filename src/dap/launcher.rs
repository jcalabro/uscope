//! `uscope dap-launcher`, which a client runs in a terminal to launch a
//! program whose streams belong to that terminal. It waits until the adapter
//! traces it and then executes the program, so the adapter sees the program
//! from its first instruction.
//!
//! It must stay single-threaded, or the exec could happen on a thread the
//! adapter does not trace, so it runs before any async runtime starts.
