//! Steps through an async function's awaits.
//!
//! An async function's body runs in a function that its future's every
//! poll calls anew. A poll that reaches an await of a future that is not
//! ready returns `Pending` to its caller, with the future's state saying
//! where it waits. A step over or out of such a body does not end in the
//! caller then: it waits for the same future to be polled again, at the
//! point where that state resumes, and goes on from there as the step it
//! was. The future is pinned, so its address names it from one poll to the
//! next, whichever thread polls it; another future of the same function
//! that resumes there is not the step's.
//!
//! An optimized build may inline one async function's body into another's,
//! where it has no resume points of its own and may not name its future.
//! The step then follows the future of the function it is inlined into,
//! whose poll runs both, and once that poll returns `Pending`, waits for
//! the future to come back to the inlined body's statements, or to those
//! on another line of the code it is inlined into. A future names its
//! task, so where even that future's address is unavailable, the task
//! does.
//!
//! A step may also begin in a task no thread runs, at one of the async
//! functions it awaits in: it begins waiting for that function's future,
//! as if a poll of it had just returned `Pending`.
//!
//! A future may be dropped while the step waits for it: its runtime drops
//! a task's future as it cancels the task, and a `select!` or a timeout
//! drops a future it no longer awaits. The step watches the future's drop
//! glue for that, every copy of it: each unit of code that drops the type
//! may have its own, and optimization inlines others, which a thread of the
//! step's task runs for the task's future. Dropped by its runtime, the
//! future's task was cancelled, and the step ends there; dropped by the
//! program's code, the step goes on in that code to its next line.
//!
//! The step also watches its runtime take up its task again, as the runtime
//! model names the code that does: the task may end there, cancelled or
//! finished, even within the poll the step waits after, with nothing left
//! to drop that the step can see. Whatever frees the task stops a thread
//! first, so the task's state still says how it ended.
