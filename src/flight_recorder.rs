//! A record of what the debugger did, kept by development builds only.
//!
//! Every client request, native control call, wait status, classification,
//! and published event is appended to a bounded in-memory ring as one line,
//! stamped with the time since the first record and the thread that made it.
//! The test harness writes the ring to a file when a test fails, and the
//! `uscope` binary streams every line to a file as it is recorded, so the
//! recording survives a killed process. Release builds compile none of this.
