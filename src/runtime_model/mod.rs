//! What a language runtime tells the debugger at one stop: which tasks it
//! schedules, which task each thread runs, and where a parked task's frames
//! begin.
//!
//! Static facts about code, such as which functions switch stacks, belong
//! to the debug-info provider. Facts about one stop of one process belong
//! here. A runtime model is pure: it reaches a program only through
//! [`RuntimeImage`], the static facts of the module that carries the
//! runtime, and [`RuntimeStop`], one validated stop. A boundary test keeps
//! process control, debug-information parsing, I/O, clocks, and threads out
//! of it, and keeps every language's runtime in a module of its own.
