//! Caps the live heap of a test process, so that a test allocating without
//! bound aborts before it and its concurrent siblings fill the machine's
//! memory. Past the cap an allocation fails, which aborts the process after
//! this module names the cap. Beneath the cap, uscope's counting allocator
//! counts what each thread allocates, and what every thread does while a
//! test measures totals, so a test can measure work that runs on threads of
//! its own. Blocks come from mimalloc, as they do in uscope itself, which
//! reads debug information far faster with it than with the C library's
//! allocator.
