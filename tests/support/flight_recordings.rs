//! Keeps the flight recordings of a failing test.
//!
//! A development build records what the debugger does: in this process for
//! scenarios, and in each adapter process for DAP sessions. A test's
//! recordings are kept under the recorder's `tests` directory when anything
//! in the test panics, whenever that happens, so a comparison that fails
//! after its sessions ended keeps them too. Otherwise they are discarded, and
//! the directory holds only the recordings of tests that failed when last
//! run. Nextest runs each test in its own process, so everything this
//! process records belongs to one test. Release builds record nothing.
