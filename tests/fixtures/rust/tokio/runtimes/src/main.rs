//! Two runtimes in one process, two `LocalSet`s, and a thread of the
//! program's own. A multi-thread runtime has two tasks parked; a
//! current-thread runtime, which a thread of its own blocks on, has two;
//! a `LocalSet` that another current-thread runtime's thread runs has two,
//! and one that a thread blocking on the multi-thread runtime runs has
//! two, which no runtime lists. A plain thread waits on a channel.
//!
//! Once every task has registered its await and every thread is parked,
//! the program reports its truth and stops at the checkpoint `parked`,
//! where neither set is running. Then it wakes the second set's task `go`,
//! which stops at `task_reached` while the set runs it, and releases
//! everything.
