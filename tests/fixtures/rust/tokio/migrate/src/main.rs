//! A task that resumes on another thread than it parked on. It parks at a
//! gate on one worker; a task the program spawns until one runs on that
//! same thread holds the thread in `block_in_place`, which hands the
//! worker's core to a new thread, until the task has resumed. Once that
//! thread has taken the core and parked, a thread outside the runtime
//! opens the gate, so the wake goes through the runtime's inject queue, to
//! a thread other than the held one.
//!
//! The program prints `TRUTH migrated ME BEFORE AFTER` with the task's id
//! and both threads, and `TRUTH holder ID TID` for the task holding the
//! thread.
