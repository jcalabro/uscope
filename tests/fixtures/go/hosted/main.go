// A Go library that a C program hosts, built -buildmode=c-shared. The
// runtime starts as the library loads, before the host's main, and keeps
// each thread's goroutine in the library's thread-local storage, which its
// code finds through a slot the loader fills. The host calls Triple on its
// own thread, which the runtime adopts for the call.
