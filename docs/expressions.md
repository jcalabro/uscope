# Expressions

uscope reads expressions in one language for every program it debugs,
whether it is written in C, C++, Rust, Go, or Zig. The language is small and
exact, and the same everywhere: it has no per-language parsers, type checkers,
or compilers behind it.

Arithmetic gives the mathematically true answer, never a wrapped or
promoted one, and bit operations keep their operand's width. Nothing converts
implicitly except where this page says so, and a value the program cannot
provide, such as an optimized-out variable, is reported as unavailable rather
than guessed.

Every example on this page runs as one of uscope's tests, against small worlds
of variables. Each row reads `expression => outcome`. An outcome is a value
and its type, `value : type`; `reads as` and the expression's normal form, the
spelling uscope prints it in; `error` and the kind of error with the text it
points at; or `unavailable` and the operand whose value the program could not
provide.

## Names

A name is `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Names may be qualified with `::`, and
`::name` starts from the outermost scope. Backticks quote any other name,
including one with `/`, `-`, spaces, or angle brackets, and one that is
otherwise a keyword.

A dotted name such as Go's `main.counter` names a global when one has that
whole name; otherwise the dots select members. The longest name the frame
knows is taken first.

`$name` reads a register of the selected frame, such as `$rax` or `$rip`, and
`$pc`, `$sp`, and `$fp` name the program counter, stack pointer, and frame
pointer.

`$task` is the id of the selected task, or of the task the selected thread
runs, an exact integer: in Go, a goroutine's, so a breakpoint's condition
`$task == 7` stops only in goroutine 7. Where the program has no tasks, or uscope cannot tell which one
a thread runs, `$task` is refused; a thread between tasks, such as one idle
in Go's scheduler, has none, and `$task` is unavailable there.

```uscope-example
ns::counter               => reads as `ns::counter`
::counter                 => reads as `::counter`
`github.com/acme/pkg.x`   => reads as `` `github.com/acme/pkg.x` ``
`Vec<i32>`::len           => reads as `` `Vec<i32>`::len ``
`as` + 1                  => reads as `` `as` + 1 ``
main.counter              => reads as `main.counter`
$rip                      => reads as `$rip`
naïve                     => error syntax at `ï`
$                         => error syntax at `$`
```

A name that several variables share is ambiguous, and the error lists how to
qualify each. Typedefs and qualifiers such as `const` keep their names but
behave as the types they stand for, and a C++ reference stands for what it
refers to. In a caller's frame, registers hold what unwinding recovered, and
one it could not recover is unavailable.

A word that C reserves for a type, such as `long`, `int`, `class`, or
`const`, is a name wherever a type cannot be, since a Go, Rust, or Zig
program may name a variable or member with it: `long * 2` multiplies the
variable `long`. Inside a cast's parentheses, after `as`, and in `sizeof`, the
word is the type.

```uscope-example
world: memory
s.a                    => 5 : int
ptr->b                 => 7 : long int
$rip                   => 4198400 : u64
$pc                    => 4198400 : u64
missing                => error unknown-name at `missing`
`s`.a                  => 5 : int

$rbp                   => unavailable at `$rbp`
$rbp + 1               => unavailable at `$rbp`
$nope                  => error unknown-name at `$nope`

$task                  => 7 : integer
$task == 7             => true : bool
long                   => 3 : int
long * 2               => 6 : integer
words.int + words.class => 10 : integer
(long)-1               => -1 : long int
sizeof(long)           => 8 : integer
```

```uscope-example

$task                  => error unsupported at `$task`
```

## Literals

Integers are decimal, or `0x`, `0o`, or `0b` prefixed, and may contain `_`.
A suffix naming a built-in type gives a literal that type: `255u8`, `1_i64`,
`3usize`. A literal without a suffix is an exact integer.

A leading zero is refused, because C reads `017` as octal and other languages
read it as decimal. C suffixes such as `UL` are refused too; cast instead.

Floats have a fraction or an exponent: `1.5`, `1e9`, `2.5e-3`. They are
binary64 unless suffixed `f32`, and a float never ends in `.`, so `a[1..4]`
is a range. `'a'` is a character's code point, and `"text"` is a string,
which compares with the program's text. Both take the escapes `\n`, `\r`,
`\t`, `\0`, `\\`, `\'`, `\"`, `\xHH`, and `\u{H…}`.

`true`, `false`, and `null` mean what they say, and `nil` is a second
spelling of `null`, which prints as `null`. `nullptr` and `NULL` are refused
with a hint to write `null`: C's `NULL` is a macro, and the two spellings
are enough for a condition to read the same in every language.

```uscope-example
0x2a + 0b1010_1010 + 0o17 => reads as `42 + 170 + 15`
0xffu8                    => reads as `255u8`
1_000_i64                 => reads as `1000i64`
2.5f32 + 1e3              => reads as `2.5f32 + 1000.0`
'\x41' == 'A'             => reads as `'A' == 'A'`
"tab\tquote\""            => reads as `"tab\tquote\""`

17UL                      => error syntax at `17UL`
1.5u8                     => error syntax at `1.5u8`

'ab'                      => error syntax at `'a`
nil                       => reads as `null`
nullptr                   => error syntax at `nullptr`
```

3usize                 => 3 : u64
```

## Operators

From loosest to tightest:

| Operators | Grouping |
|---|---|
| `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `&=` `\|=` `^=` `<<=` `>>=` | right |
| `?:` | right |
| `\|\|` | left |
| `&&` | left |
| `==` `!=` `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | none |
| `\|` | left |
| `^` | left |
| `&` | left |
| `<<` `>>` | left |
| `+` `-` | left |
| `*` `/` `%` | left |
| `as` | left |
| prefix `-` `!` `~` `*` `&`, casts `(T)x`, `sizeof` | right |
| postfix `.` `->` `[]` | left |

Bit operations bind tighter than comparisons, so `x & 1 == 0` means
`(x & 1) == 0`, and comparisons do not chain. `.` selects a member, and also
selects through one pointer; `->` selects through a pointer as in C;
`t.0` selects a tuple's field. A member of an anonymous struct or union, or
of a base class, is selected by its own name, as C and C++ select it: a
record's own members hide its bases', and a name that two paths reach in
different objects is ambiguous. A member of a Go embedded field is promoted
as Go promotes it: `n.W` selects the `W` of the shallowest embedded field
that has one, through an embedded pointer too, and several at that depth
are ambiguous, the error naming each. `a[start..end]` is a half-open range
of an array or slice, and must be the whole expression; `a[start:end]`
slices (see Slices), and `m[key]` indexes a map (see Maps). `len(x)` is a
length, `cap(x)` a capacity, and `sizeof(x)` a size. The language does not
call functions.

```uscope-example
a+b*c                     => reads as `a + b * c`
x & 1 == 0                => reads as `x & 1 == 0`
(x & 1) == 0              => reads as `x & 1 == 0`
x & (1 == 0)              => reads as `x & (1 == 0)`
1 << 70 >> 68             => reads as `1 << 70 >> 68`
a - (b - c)               => reads as `a - (b - c)`
a ? b : c ? d : e         => reads as `a ? b : c ? d : e`
-x as u8                  => reads as `-x as u8`
-(x as u8)                => reads as `-(x as u8)`
p->items[i + 1].0         => reads as `p->items[i + 1].0`
&(&x)                     => reads as `& &x`
a[1..4]                   => reads as `a[1..4]`
s[1:3]                    => reads as `s[1:3]`
s[:n]                     => reads as `s[:n]`
s[i + 1:]                 => reads as `s[i + 1:]`
s[:]                      => reads as `s[:]`
s[c ? 1 : 2:3]            => reads as `s[c ? 1 : 2:3]`
cap(s)                    => reads as `cap(s)`
1 < 2 < 3                 => error syntax at `<`
a[1..4] + 1               => error syntax at `a[1..4]`
s[1:2:3]                  => error syntax at `:`
f(x)                      => error syntax at `f(`
a +                       => error syntax at ``
```

## Arithmetic is exact

`+ - * / %` compute the true result. No operand's type limits it: two `u8`
values add to a number above 255, and subtracting from an unsigned value can
go below zero. Results range over every value a 128-bit integer of either
signedness holds, from −2^127 to 2^128 − 1; beyond that, and dividing by
zero, are errors. Division truncates toward zero and the remainder takes the
dividend's sign, as C, Rust, and Go agree.

To get a program's wrapping arithmetic, cast the result: `(u8)(uc + 10)`.

```uscope-example
world: scalars
uc + 10                => 260 : integer
(u8)(uc + 10)          => 4 : u8
u32v + u32v            => 8000000000 : integer
0 - u32v               => -4000000000 : integer
i32v * 1000000         => -123456000000 : integer
-7 / 2                 => -3 : integer
-7 % 2                 => -1 : integer
7 % -2                 => 1 : integer
u64v * u64v            => 340282366920938463426481119284349108225 : integer
u64v * u64v * 2        => error arithmetic at `u64v * u64v * 2`
0 - u64v * u64v        => error arithmetic at `0 - u64v * u64v`
1 / 0                  => error arithmetic at `1 / 0`
-u32v                  => -4000000000 : integer
flag + 1               => error type at `flag`
```

Comparisons are exact too, so signed and unsigned values compare as numbers.

```uscope-example
world: scalars
-1 < 1u32              => true : bool
i32v < u32v            => true : bool
u32v - 1 > 0           => true : bool
sc == -7               => true : bool
```

## Bit operations keep their width

`~ & | ^ << >>` work on a value's bits at the width of its type, and the
result keeps that type. When two typed operands meet, the wider one's type
wins, and between equal widths, the unsigned one's. An exact integer meeting
a typed one must fit its width, as either a signed or an unsigned value.
Exact integers alone behave as infinite two's complement.

`>>` is arithmetic for a signed value and logical for an unsigned one, and
`<<` drops the bits it shifts past the width. A shift's result has the type
of the value shifted. A shift by a negative amount, or by the width or more,
is an error.

```uscope-example
world: scalars
~uc                    => 5 : unsigned char
uc << 1                => 244 : unsigned char
uc >> 4                => 15 : unsigned char
sc >> 1                => -4 : signed char
uc & 0x0f              => 10 : unsigned char
uc | 0x100             => error arithmetic at `0x100`
i32v & 0xffff_ffff     => -123456 : int
uc << 8                => error arithmetic at `uc << 8`
1 << 70 >> 68          => 4 : integer
-1 << 1u32             => -2 : integer
~0                     => -1 : integer
-4 >> 1                => -2 : integer
uc << -1               => error arithmetic at `uc << -1`
sc >> 8                => error arithmetic at `sc >> 8`
u16v >> 15             => 1 : short unsigned int
uc & u16v              => 250 : short unsigned int
```

## Floating point

Floats compute in the widest format among their operands, and an integer
operand converts to the nearest value. x87 `long double` values compute
exactly in their own format, never rounded through a double. Floats compare
with integers exactly.

```uscope-example
world: scalars
f * 2                  => 3.0 : f32
f + d                  => 11.5 : f64
d / 4                  => 2.5 : f64
ld * 2                 => 2.5 : f80
ld + 1                 => 2.25 : f80
1.0 / 0.0              => inf : f64
f == 1.5               => true : bool
9007199254740993 == 9007199254740993.0 => false : bool
0.0 / 0.0              => NaN : f64
0.0 / 0.0 == 0.0 / 0.0 => false : bool
0.0 / 0.0 != 0.0 / 0.0 => true : bool
-d                     => -10.0 : f64
f & 1                  => error type at `f`
```

## Truth values

`!`, `&&`, `||`, and `?:` take truth values: booleans, or numbers and pointers,
which are true when nonzero. `&&`, `||`, and `?:` evaluate only what they
need, so `ptr != null && ptr->a > 3` never follows a null pointer. Booleans
are not numbers; convert one with `flag as u8`.

```uscope-example
world: memory
null_ptr != null && null_ptr->a > 3 => false : bool
ptr != null && ptr->a > 3          => true : bool
ptr != nil                         => true : bool
!ptr                               => false : bool
s.a > 3 ? 1 : 2                    => 1 : integer
false && gone > 0                  => false : bool
0 ? gone : 1                       => 1 : integer
ptr == null || gone > 0            => unavailable at `gone`
s && true                          => error type at `s`
```

## Pointers, arrays, and members

`*p` dereferences, `&x` takes an address, `p[i]` is `*(p + i)`, and `p + n`
moves by `n` elements. Only a value in memory has an address: one optimized
code keeps in a register, computes, or splits across several places has
none, though a member of it that lies in memory does. `p - q` counts the
elements between two pointers, which must be a whole number of elements
apart. Elements of a zero-sized type, such as Rust's `()`, all share one
address, so a pointer to one moves nowhere and two such pointers have no
count between them. Pointers compare with pointers, `null`, and `0`; to
compare an address with another number, cast the pointer. Arrays index by
each of their dimensions, and decay to a pointer to their first element in
arithmetic. A slice's index is checked against its length when the
expression runs.

```uscope-example
world: memory
*ip                    => 22 : int
ip[1]                  => 33 : int

&arr[3] - &arr[0]      => 3 : integer
ptr.a                  => 5 : int
(*ptr).b               => 7 : long int
arr[2]                 => 33 : int
*arr                   => 11 : int
*(arr + 1)             => 22 : int
m[1][2]                => 6 : int
m[1]                   => error type at `m[1]`
arr[4]                 => error bounds at `arr[4]`
items[1]               => 20 : int
items[5]               => unavailable at `items[5]`
len(items)             => 3 : integer
len(arr)               => 4 : integer
*null_ptr              => unavailable at `*null_ptr`
ptr != 0               => true : bool
ptr == 3               => error type at `ptr == 3`
(u64)ip - (u64)&arr[0] => 4 : integer
ip - arr               => 1 : integer
(int*)((u8*)ip + 1) - ip => error arithmetic at `(int*)((u8*)ip + 1) - ip`
&ep[5] == ep           => true : bool
ep - ep                => error type at `ep - ep`
arr + 1 == ip          => true : bool
vp + 1                 => error type at `vp`
*vp                    => error type at `vp`
*s                     => error type at `s`
s.missing              => error type at `missing`
s->a                   => error type at `s`
&r                     => error not-an-lvalue at `r`
gone + 1               => unavailable at `gone`
```

## Slices

`x[start:end]` is the part of an array, a slice, or text from index `start`
up to, not including, `end`. A bound left out is the beginning or the end:
`x[:end]`, `x[start:]`, and `x[:]`. When the expression runs, `0 <= start
<= end <= len(x)` must hold, or it is a bounds error. Unlike Go, a slice's
room beyond its length is not reachable this way, since what is there is
not part of its value; Go's `x[low:high:max]` is not supported.

Slicing an array or slice is the range of its elements `x[start..end]`, and
like a range must be the whole expression. Slicing text, which is a
language's string or what a character pointer points to, is text: a string
that compares with `==` and `!=`, has a length, slices again, and prints.

```uscope-example
world: memory
items[1:3]             => range 1..3
items[:2]              => range 0..2
items[1:]              => range 1..3
arr[:]                 => range 0..4
arr[2:2]               => range 2..2
items[2:1]             => error bounds at `items[2:1]`
items[1:4]             => error bounds at `items[1:4]`
items[1:3] == 1        => error type at `items[1:3]`
name[1:3]              => "el" : string
name[:4] == "hell"     => true : bool
name[1:] != "ello"     => false : bool
len(name[2:])          => 3 : integer
name[2:][1:]           => "lo" : string
"hello"[1:3] == "el"   => true : bool
name[3:9]              => error bounds at `name[3:9]`
s[0:1]                 => error type at `s`
ptr[0:1]               => error type at `ptr`
```

## Maps

`m[key]` is the value a map holds for a key, when a view presents `m` as a
map (`docs/views.md`): Go's maps, and the maps of the C++, Rust, and Zig
standard libraries. A key is a number, truth value, pointer, or string, or
text the program holds, and finds the entry whose key `==` would call equal
to it, so numbers compare exactly and `m[2.0]` finds the key `2`. A key of a
type the map's keys cannot equal, such as a string in a map of integers, is
a type error, and a key the map does not hold is a missing-key error, never
a zero value. The entries are searched in the view's order, as far as the
inspection's budget allows. A map is never indexed by position.

```uscope-example
world: memory
squares[3]             => 9 : int
squares[3u8]           => 9 : int
squares[2.0]           => 4 : int
squares[4]             => error missing-key at `squares[4]`
squares["3"]           => error type at `squares["3"]`
ages["bob"]            => 41 : int
ages[name]             => error missing-key at `ages[name]`
ages[name[:3]]         => error missing-key at `ages[name[:3]]`
ages["ann"] + squares[1] => 31 : integer
ages[s]                => error type at `s`
ages[arr]              => error type at `arr`
```

## Casts

`(T)x` and `x as T` convert a value. `T` may be a built-in type (`iN` and
`uN` for N from 1 to 128, `isize`, `usize`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`), a type the
program defines, a C base type written with its words in any order, or a
`struct`, `union`, `enum`, or `class` tag. `const`, `volatile`, and `mut` are
accepted and ignored. A pointer type is `T*` inside a cast's parentheses,
where `(*p)` dereferences, and `*T` after `as`, where a trailing `*` would
multiply.

A program type is named by what it is, not by how its compiler spelled it.
Its outer namespaces, modules, and packages may be left off, as may inline
namespaces such as libc++'s `std::__1`, and a template's trailing arguments,
which C++ fills with defaults: `` std::`vector<int>` `` names
`std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >`. A name that fits several different
types is ambiguous, and the error lists them.

`(name) - 1` subtracts when `name` is a value and casts `-1` when it is a
type, and the two readings group the rest of the expression differently:
`(n) - a * b` is `n - (a * b)`, while `(T) - a * b` is `((T)(-a)) * b`. Such a
parenthesized name before `-`, `*`, or `&` is read whichever way the name
is, as C reads it, with a value in scope winning. Anything else after the
parentheses is unambiguous: `(n) + 1` always adds, and `(T)x` always casts.
An expression may hold at most four such names.

```uscope-example
(unsigned long)-1         => reads as `(unsigned long)-1`
(long unsigned)-1         => reads as `(unsigned long)-1`
(const char*)p            => reads as `(char*)p`
(struct node*)p           => reads as `(struct node*)p`
(T)(-1)                   => reads as `(T)(-1)`
(T)x                      => reads as `(T)x`
x as *const u8            => reads as `x as *u8`
x as unsigned long + 1    => reads as `x as unsigned long + 1`
x as T * 2                => reads as `x as T * 2`
(n) + 1                   => reads as `n + 1`
(n) - 1                   => reads as `(n) - 1`
sizeof(int*)              => reads as `sizeof(int*)`
(int)                     => error syntax at ``
(a)-(b)-(c)-(d)-(e)-f     => error limit at `(`
```

Casting an integer truncates its two's complement. Casting a float to an
integer rounds toward zero and saturates at the type's bounds; a NaN cannot be
cast. Integers and pointers convert into each other as addresses, and anything
with a truth value casts to `bool`. A cast cannot reinterpret a whole record;
reinterpret its storage through a pointer instead. Casting a C++ object to one
of its base classes is that base's part of it, as `static_cast` makes it, and
is ambiguous when the object holds several. Casting a value to the type it
already has changes nothing.

((Shape)twice_shaped).id => error ambiguous-name at `((Shape)twice_shaped)`
(Tile)s                => error type at `(Tile)s`
```

## Enumerations

An enumerator's name means its value. Next to a value of an enumeration, a
bare enumerator name is found among that enumeration's enumerators, so
`color == RED` works even where `RED` alone is ambiguous. An integer casts to
an enumeration, whether or not an enumerator has its value.

```uscope-example
world: memory
color                  => BLUE : Color
color == BLUE          => true : bool
color == Color::GREEN  => false : bool
color + 1              => 3 : integer
(f64)BLUE              => 2.0 : f64
sign < POSITIVE        => true : bool
NEGATIVE < POSITIVE    => true : bool
-(Small::TWO << 1)     => -4 : integer
Small::HIGH << 1       => 0 : Small
RED                    => error ambiguous-name at `RED`
color == RED           => false : bool
light == RED           => false : bool
light == Light::AMBER  => true : bool
```

## Text

A string literal compares with the program's text: a `char*`, a character
array, or a language's string type. Text that could not be read to its end
does not compare at all, unless what was read already differs.

```uscope-example
world: memory
name == "hello"        => true : bool
name != "help"         => true : bool
buf == "abc"           => true : bool
name < "hello"         => error type at `name < "hello"`
partial == "hello"     => unavailable at `partial`
partial == "xyz"       => false : bool
"hello"                => error type at `"hello"`
```

## Sizes and lengths

`sizeof(x)` and `sizeof(T)` give a size in bytes without reading anything.
`len(x)` gives an array's or slice's element count, or the length in bytes of
text: a language's string, or what a character pointer points to. An array of
characters is an array, so its length is its element count.

`cap(x)` gives how many elements `x` has room for: an array's element count,
the capacity a slice records, as Go's slices do, or what the `capacity`
field of the view that presents `x` says, as the views of Go's channels, of
C++'s vectors and strings, and of Rust's and Zig's lists do. Anything else,
a Go map among them, has no capacity.

```uscope-example
world: memory
sizeof(s)              => 16 : integer
sizeof(S)              => 16 : integer
sizeof(struct S)       => 16 : integer
sizeof(int)            => 4 : integer
sizeof(arr)            => 16 : integer
sizeof(u128)           => 16 : integer
sizeof(ptr)            => 8 : integer
sizeof(1)              => error type at `sizeof(1)`
len(name)              => 5 : integer
len(buf)               => 8 : integer
len(s)                 => error type at `s`
cap(arr)               => 4 : integer
cap(spare)             => 5 : integer
len(spare)             => 3 : integer
cap(items)             => error type at `items`
cap(s)                 => error type at `s`
cap(1)                 => error type at `1`
```

## Assignment

In the console and with `set var`, `=` and the compound operators (`+=`,
`<<=`, …) assign, and an assignment must be the whole expression. The value
must fit the target's type exactly; to store a wrapped or rounded value, cast
it first. Only numbers, truth values, enumerations, and pointers are
assigned. The result is the target read again. Hovering, watching, and
breakpoint conditions cannot assign.

```uscope-example
world: scalars
assign: uc = 7         => 7 : unsigned char
assign: uc -= 10       => 240 : unsigned char
assign: uc += 10       => error assignment at `uc += 10`
assign: uc = 256       => error assignment at `256`
assign: uc = (u8)256   => 0 : unsigned char
assign: uc = -6        => error assignment at `-6`
assign: flag = 1       => true : _Bool
assign: flag = 2       => error assignment at `2`
assign: d = 3          => 3.0 : double
assign: f = 0.1        => error assignment at `0.1`
assign: f = 0.5        => 0.5 : float
assign: f = 0.1f32     => 0.1 : float
assign: i32v = 2.0     => 2 : int
assign: i32v = 2.5     => error assignment at `2.5`
uc = 7                 => error mode at `uc = 7`
assign: uc + 1 = 2     => error not-an-lvalue at `uc + 1`
assign: uc = sc = 1    => error mode at `sc = 1`
```

```uscope-example
world: memory
assign: color = GREEN  => GREEN : Color
assign: ptr = 0        => 0x0 : S*
assign: ptr = 1.5      => error type at `1.5`
assign: s = s          => error type at `s`
assign: r = 3          => 3 : int
```
